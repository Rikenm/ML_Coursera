Hello!

University records indicate that you may be intending to graduate in 2018.

If you intend to graduate in January 2018, May 2018, or September 2018, you MUST
file your "Intent to Graduate".  It is a simple web-form that can be completed
in less than 5 minutes. (see link below)

After you submit your form, and prior to the start of the fall 2017 semester,
you will receive a review of your degree progress from an advisor in CAS
Advising.  Filing your Intent to Graduate will also place you on official
graduation lists so that you may receive timely information regarding
commencement from various University departments.

Deadlines are as follows:

January 2018 - deadline was January 2017 (please still submit!)
May 2018 - deadline is June 1, 2017
September 2018 - deadline is September 1, 2017

If you intend to graduate sometime in 2019 or later, you can ignore this message.

Thank you,
Kerry Buglio
